# capstone - Increasing lead–to-order conversion rate & regional sales
## Executive summary
RS Automation has a problem related to lead conversion into order and low regional sales of
the Ankleshawar region. To understand the problem better and to give important insights,
analysis is done on various aspects of “lead’s conversion to Opportunity” and “Opportunity’s
conversion to an order”. Those aspects include from which source the lead is generated, to
whom the lead is assigned, and what frequent reasons are seen as a reason for loss of
Opportunity. The very good thing about the company is that they store the reason for losing
any opportunity and also an approximate amount of which the client wanted to give an order.
Various important tables are made after analyzing the data, and from those tables, graphs are
drawn. Some graphs give very interesting and also important information related to the
problem. For example, a graph made from the amount the company has lost because of the lost
opportunity, tells that the company has lost INR 26.21 lakh because 17 customers thought the
product has a high price.
Along with the analysis and finding insights this report also includes a few suggestions to
overcome or to say to tackle the problem in some sense, i.e. As because the company has lost
INR 7.08 lakh because 10 customers had identification problems with the company, It’s
recommended that the company get some respected and known certificates in the industry, i.e.
ISO Certification.
